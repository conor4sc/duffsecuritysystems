          We had to create a smart home device to try and aid the average homeowner to protect their home. The growing scurge of burglary is evident throughout society. No one can hide! According to the CSO there were 10,938 burglarys in Ireland in 2020. This figure alarms us at Super Duper Security. Because of this we at Super Duper Security decided to build a device that can immediately identify when a someone is present in your premisis and send you an email that contains a photo of this would be intruder the minute they enter your dwelling. To build this device we utilised a raspberry pi using the raspberry pi os that was then connected to a pir motion sensor and a camera. The raspberry pi used a micro-usb cable to as a power supply. Here below are the various components contained in our product:
